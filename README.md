This project demonstrates the convergence of option pricing calculated using the binomial-tree model with an increasing number of steps (𝑛) to the exact value computed via the Black-Scholes formula.

The results show that the accuracy of the binomial-tree method improves as the number of steps grows, approaching the value provided by the Black-Scholes formula when 𝑛 = 1000.
